            "Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \n",
            "and extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \n",
            "documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \n",
            "provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \n",

            "Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \n",
            "Greenhouse Gases \n",
            "The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \n",

            "for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \n",
            "activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. \n",
